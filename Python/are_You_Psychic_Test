#1. generate a random number between 100 and 9999 by using random.randint() YUP
#2. use a while loop to allow the user to make continuous guesses, and check to 
   #if they guess correctly

#note I could reduce code by doing else: but I learn more by doing elif
#all done by me. It was like a reg hatch project took hours to do it and it was fun :)
